            <p>We will review your designs (website or mobile/web app) 
                and explore where the design works well and where it 
                can be improved. We focus our process around one central 
                question: “What can we do to make this design more efficient?”</p>

            <h2>Deliverables</h2>
            <h5>A picture is worth a thousand words</h5>
            <p>Unlike any other design review or audit, 
                we will not only tell you what can be improved 
                but also make revamps to the most critical parts
                of the design.</p>
            <h5>Design Report</h5>
            <p>We will evaluate your design based on a variety of 
                parameters and provide a detailed visual report with 
                useful tips and design hacks. This would be the starting 
                point for further work on the design.</p>
            <h5>Ways to Redesign</h5>
            <p>We provide several strategies for further redesign by various contractors, from freelancers to high-end agencies. We provide you with an assessment of the timing and cost for both a full redesign and quick but effective improvements.</p>
